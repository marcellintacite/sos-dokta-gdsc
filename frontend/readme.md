# SOS Doctor

Sos Dokta is an amazing app that helps people in our town get access to health information that can save lives. With this app, you can easily find the emergency number, nearby hospital, first aid, sexual education, and more. Sos Dokta is also aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are a call for action by all countries to promote prosperity while protecting the planet. By providing health information to our community, Sos Dokta contributes to SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities).
