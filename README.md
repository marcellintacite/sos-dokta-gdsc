## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sosdokta-auth.appspot.com/o/Home.png?alt=media&token=181ecf8a-20c2-4726-abd8-5da11bc998bb)

Sos Dokta is an amazing app that helps people in our town get access to health information that can save lives. With this app, you can easily find the emergency number, nearby hospital, first aid, sexual education, and more. Sos Dokta is also aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are a call for action by all countries to promote prosperity while protecting the planet. By providing health information to our community, Sos Dokta contributes to SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Sos Dokta is more than just an app, it is a mission to ensure that no one can die again by the lack of health information.

## Built With

For the development of our solution, SOS Dokta, we have chosen to use a client-server architecture pattern, with a backend built using Django, a frontend built using React, and authentication handled using Firebase. Additionally, we are utilizing Google Maps for location-related functionalities.

\*Technologies - We are using Firebase for authentication and authorization purposes, and Google Maps for location-related APIs. Firebase is an excellent tool for user authentication as it provides a complete suite of authentication services like email, SMS, social login, etc., that can be quickly integrated into an application. Google Maps has some powerful APIs that we intend to use for obtaining data on nearby hospitals, emergency services, and other health-related resources.

\*Programming languages and tools used - We are using Python and Django for our backend component, and JavaScript and React for our frontend component. We will be utilizing Git and Github for version control and source code management, which provides an excellent collaboration platform for our team.
In summary, we have chosen a client-server architectural pattern with Django for the backend, React for the frontend, Firebase for authentication, and Google Maps for location-related functionalities.
